<h3>Initiative/Innovation</h3>

<pre>
	Initiative:  the ability to assess and initiate things independently. 
	Innovation:   the action or process of innovating. 
	I have the skill to create innovative solutions to intricate computer problems which I used when I worked with BizZone  where I used this skill to help find and resolve security issues in the CMS system that was used by them which resulted in a security patch being pushed to everyone protecting the clients for possible cyber attacks  
	 
	the project can be found at the403.ml/mtm/ 
	 
	The project that best shows my initiative/innovation was the message to myself assignment. this is because I used my coding knowledge learned through online line classes and work experience to create a project that was what I believe above ant beyond what most others have done allowing me to show off my innovation when faced with the task of creating/complete projects that require you to stand out of a large group of people.
