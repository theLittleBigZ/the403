    	<h1>My personal Goal</h1>
    	<h4>Goal: Is to drop your average running speed for a 10 km run from 8 minute/km to below 7 minute/km</h4>
    	<p>
    		Let’s cut to the chase this is a message from past me to you, future me (and/or Professor Tacorda) but definitely to someone in the future. As now I have three goals I want to achieve by November to January 2018/2019 respectably. These include one personal goal, one professional goal, and one academic goal. Let’s start with my (our) personal goal. By November 30th I want you to drop your average running speed for a 10 km run from 8 minutes/km to below 7 minutes/km (preferably 6.5 minutes/km). Now you know the what, here the why. As of right now I can consistently manage 8 km/minute for a 10 km run and on my best day I hit 7.25 minutes/km I want to do even better for two main reasons: one, to increase our overall stamina by doing a lot of cardio (and increase our heart functionality). And two, to bring us closer to the average pace for an adult male and hope some after finishing this goal the next can be to drop to the average pace which is about 5.22 minutes/kilometer. I plan to do this by working out a minimum of once a week and going on a 10 km run every Saturday, recording my time to track my progress my sub-goal will be to drop my time by at least 0.125 minutes/km every Saturday. I will also be using apps like runtastic for monitoring and feedback on my progress.
