        <h1>My Academic Goal</h1>
        <h4>Goal: Step up a system / routine  that allows me to have an 2 hours of study per class per week while also giving me Fridays to catch up on social events</h4>
        <p>
           Finally, our (at this point you’re going to have to do these things so I’m going to call it our) academic goal is pretty simple but probably the hardest is to step up a system/routine that allows for 2 hours of studying per class per week that also gives me Friday and Saturday to hang-out with friends and mostly just to have a social life. I what this for one main reason: that begin to allow me to have an escape from school work and to not lose myself in school work. I plan to achieve this by using one of two calendars, either a physical agenda or a digital one like google calendar to sort and manage my time. And the sub-goals I must make sure I do the steps required to achieve this is to track and make sure I give myself the time throughout the week to achieve a social weekend.
