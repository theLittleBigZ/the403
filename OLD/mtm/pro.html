        <h1>My Professional Goal</h1>
        <h4>Goal: I want to have finished my CMS project</h4>
        <p>
           Now my (again it should be our) professional goal. By December, I want to have finished my CMS project for context a Content Management System (CMS) is similar to products and services like Blogger and Square Space used to help build websites and well manage content on said site. My goal is to build/code my own from scratch for a couple of reasons. Firstly, to increase our skill and to have a project I can put on display to show off my skill to future employers. Secondly, to use it as a business/product depending on how good the CMS is I could license it out to other looks for a cheap simple way to make/manage a website, I already have talked to someone from my high-school looking for such a product so why not build one for him. I plan to do this by allocating more time to the development of this project and my moving to a new editor (I currently use sublime) which hopefully makes I workflow more efficient. I plan to track my progress with one sub-goal per month: starting with a system to create new web pages and edit existing ones, then move on to a user-login system that implements a permissions system so certain users have access to certain thing, then moving to a newsletter/emailer system to allow user to get updates for the site also making an option that each can be automated to deliver i.e. the newsletter out automatically every Tuesday at 1:00 etc.
